## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Raspberry Pi 3B
- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- Ultrasonic sensor
- Pi Camera
- Motor driver
- DC Motors

## Installation
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/raspberry-autodrive.git
```

2. Install the required Python packages.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Setup your Raspberry Pi with the ultrasonic sensor, Pi Camera, motor driver, and DC Motors as per the hardware setup guide.

## Usage
Once you have your Raspberry Pi setup and the software installed, you can start the autonomous driving program with the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```
